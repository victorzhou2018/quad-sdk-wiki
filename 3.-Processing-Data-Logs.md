### Running the MATLAB data logger
Quad Logger also contains a script to process the bags and generate MATLAB figures and animations, and automatically saves them into our specified file structure. Run
```
roscd quad_logger/bags
cp quad_log.bag <bag_name>.bag
roscd quad_logger/scripts
matlab
```
In MATLAB, open the `processLog.m` script and set the following variables:
- Set the `trialName` variable to your `<bag_name>`, or leave as a blank string (this will open a UI where you can select your bagfile directly).
- Set the `namespace` variable to your `<robot_ns>` (the namespace of the robot set in `quad_gazebo.launch`).
- set `bAnimate` to true or false depending on whether you would like to see the trajectory animated in the body frame (MATLAB is unable to visualize floating base URDFs).
- set `bSave` to true or false depending on whether you would like to save all the data and figures to a video. If yet, this will create (or overwrite) a folder named `trialName` in `quad_logger/logs` with all your data.

You can also run matlab without the desktop GUI (`matlab -nodesktop`), and call `processLog(<bag_name>)` from the command window. This will automatically animate and save the data.

The folder created from `bSave = true` will be ignored by git.

### Replay bag file in RViz

Record data:
```
roslaunch quad_utils logging.launch
```

Visualize data:
```
roslaunch quad_utils visualization.launch
roscd quad_logger/bags
rosbag play quad_log.bag
```

Use the "Reset" button in RViz to flash and rerun a new bag.
