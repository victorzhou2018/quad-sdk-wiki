# Welcome to the Quad-SDK Wiki!

Quad-SDK is designed to enable rapid deployment of autonomous agility to quadruped platforms. This Wiki provides support to new and advanced users on how to install, use, and in some cases extend the software. Numbered pages within this Wiki are meant to guide users through key features of the SDK, while remaining pages offer brief insight into other sections of the code. These pages will be continually updated as features are added - if you find anything missing or in need of correction, please request updates via the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/robomechanics/quad-sdk/issues).

## Build

Quad-SDK uses the [Catkin Tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) build system, and comes with a setup script that automatically installs the required dependencies. 

### Setup repo

1. Install Ubuntu 18.04 (dual boot or VM) ([help](https://linuxhint.com/install_ubuntu_18-04_virtualbox/))
2. Install ROS Melodic (full install recommended) ([help](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu))
3. (Required for Local Planner) Get HSL solver for IPOPT ([help](http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt)) (**Note**: For users using free license of HSL solver, there is a separate step to follow below.)
4. Create catkin workspace ([help](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment))
5. Setup repo
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
cd src
git clone https://github.com/robomechanics/quad-sdk.git
cd quad-sdk
cp -r /path/to/coinhsl ./external/ipopt/coinhsl # verify that quad-sdk/external/ipopt/coinhsl/ma27/ma27d.f is a valid path)
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin build
```
6. (**Only for users using free license of HSL solver**): Go to line 208 of ```nmpc_controller/src/nmpc_controller.cpp``` and change the ```linear_solver``` setting from ```ma57``` to ```ma27```. Recompile the program.

Note that the `main` branch is the default which contains stable, tested code. Check out `devel` for the most up-to-date code (at your own risk). Check out `neotic_devel` to work in ROS Noetics on Ubuntu 20.04.

### Dependencies

In addition to the ROS standard dependencies, the following packages are installed by the `setup.sh` script:
* [libeigen3-dev](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libeigen3-dev)
* [python3-catkin-tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html)
* [ipopt](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/)
* [rbdl-orb](https://github.com/ORB-HD/rbdl-orb)
* [mocap_optitrack](https://github.com/ros-drivers/mocap_optitrack)
* [grid_map](http://wiki.ros.org/grid_map)
* [plotjuggler-ros](https://www.plotjuggler.io/)

## Test
Always do this before pushing to any branch to confirm that tests will pass.
```bash
roslaunch quad_utils load_global_params.launch load_robot_params:=true
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin run_tests
```

## Extend

### Setup new branch
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/quad-sdk
git checkout -b <ros-distro>_<base-branch>_<package>_<description>
git push --set-upstream origin <ros-distro>_<base-branch>_<package>_<description>
```

### Lint formatting
The `main` and `devel` branches are protected to ensure proper code style. We follow the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) and run the following script within our Continuous Integration scripts to ensure proper formatting. Please run this script on your own branch before submitting a PR (we recommend configuring your text editor to automatically format your documents to follow this guide).
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/quad-sdk
./scripts/lint_soft.sh
```

### Create new package
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/quad-sdk
catkin_create_pkg quad_package_name roscpp std_msgs *other-rosdeps-here*
```
After creating a package, open package.xml and modify the package owner and contact info to be yourself.

You can also copy and existing package and edit its contents, just be sure to update the contents fully (including the package.xml and CMake Lists.txt).

### Create documentation
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/quad-sdk
doxygen Doxyfile
firefox docs/index.html
```

The repository is configured such that the [Doxygen](https://robomechanics.github.io/quad-sdk/) page will automatically update with any changes to the main branch.

### Create new custom messages
Custom messages can be placed in quad_msgs/msg. See the [ROS Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv) for details on message creation. Add your message filename to the `add_message_files()` in quad_msgs/CMakeLists.txt, and add quad_msgs as a dependency to your package. To implement and namespace your messages, refer to [this tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/DefiningCustomMessages). 

### Ghost SDK Documentation (for Spirit users)
See the documentation [here](https://ghostusers.gitlab.io/docs/). Must have access to their repository.
