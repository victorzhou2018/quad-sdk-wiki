The joint arrays in spirit_msgs::RobotState are defined such that indices 0 = abad0, 1 = hip0, 2 = knee1, 3 = abad1, 4 = hip1, 5 = knee12, 6 = abad2, 7 = hip2, 8 = knee2, 9 = abad3, 10 = hip3, 11 = knee3. Legs are numbered such that 0 = front left, 1 = back left, 2  = front right, and 3 = back right. So calling `stat_msg.joints.positions[4]` would give you the joint position of the back left hip motor.

Confusingly, Ghost Robotics does NOT use this definition, and instead has their urdf and /mcu/state/jointURDF use the following ordering: 0 = hip0, 1 = knee0, 2 = hip1, 3 = knee1, 4 = hip2, 5 = knee2, 6 = hip3, 7 = knee3, 8 = abd0, 9 = abd1, 10 = abd2, 11 = abd3. To correct this, our `ground_truth_publisher.cpp` reads their message and maps from their ordering to ours (likewise our `estimator_plugin.cpp` maps from the alphabetical order in Gazebo to our order).
