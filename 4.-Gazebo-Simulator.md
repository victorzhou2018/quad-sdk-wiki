# Gazebo Simulator

**Run Gazebo Simulator**
To launch the Gazebo simulator, run:
```roslaunch quad_utils quad_gazebo.launch arg:=value```

Refer to [Launch, Node and Topic Structure](https://github.com/robomechanics/quad-software/wiki/3.-Launch,-Node,-and-Topic-Structure) for roslaunch commands to run code on the robot. For example, stand up and track twist trajectories while logging with:
```
rostopic pub /control/mode std_msgs/UInt8 "data: 1"
roslaunch quad_utils planning.launch global_planner:=twist logging:=true
```
