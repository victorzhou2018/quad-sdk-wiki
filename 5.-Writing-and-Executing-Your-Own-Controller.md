To write your own controller and execute it on the robot, follow these steps:

1. Write your source code for your controller class and wrapper node (these instructions will assume you have some files named `controller.cpp` and `controller_node.cpp` in the `example_package` package). You can copy `open_loop_controller.cpp` as an example.
2. Update the `CMakeLists.txt` of the package containing your code to include your source code in the project library, add an executable (need this to be able to launch the node), and link the library to the executable:
```
add_library(example_package src/controller.cpp)
add_executable(controller_node src/controller_node.cpp)
target_link_libraries(controller_node example_package ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
```
3. Write a test for your code (at a bare minimum, call the constructor) and add it to the CMakeLists.txt:
```
catkin_add_gtest(controller_test test/test_controller.cpp)
target_link_libraries(controller_test example_package ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
```
4. Build your code and run the tests:
```
(In separate terminal) roslaunch spirit_utils load_params.launch
(In original terminal) cd catkin_ws
catkin_make run_tests
```
5. Modify `spirit_utils/launch/control.launch` by adding the following to include an argument for your new controller:
```
<group if="$(eval arg('controller') == '<your-controller-arg>')">
    <node name="<your-controller-name>" pkg="example_package" type="controller_node" output="screen"/>
</group>
```
6. Test your controller in simulation - refer to [Gazebo Simulation](https://github.com/robomechanics/spirit-software/wiki/4.-Gazebo-Simulator) for additional arguments:
```
roslaunch spirit_utils spirit_gazebo.launch software:=false
roslaunch spirit_utils visualization.launch
roslaunch spirit_utils control.launch controller:=<your-controller-arg>
```
7. Get your code downloaded onto the TX2.
   - Commit your code to your branch <your-branch-name> and push to GitHub
   - Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/robomechanics/spirit-software/wiki/2.-Running-the-Robot) to power the robot on
   - Connect an ethernet cable from the wall to the robot to get internet access
   - Run the following commands from a terminal on the remote computer:
```
ssh ghost@192.168.168.105
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/spirit-software
git fetch
git checkout <your-branch-name>
git pull <your-branch-name>
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```
8. Compile your code:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```
9. Set up the robot environment (answer "n" to launching the robot driver when prompted by `launch_robot_env.sh` this will launch the inverse dynamics controller by default):
```
cd ~
source launch_robot_env.sh
roslaunch spirit_utils robot_driver.launch mocap:=true controller:=none
```
10. (Optional, will only work if mocap is online) Launch the remote driver to visualize the robot in a new terminal on the remote computer:
```
source launch_remote_env.sh
```
